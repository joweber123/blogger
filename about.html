  <h2 class="about-title titleh2">Hi</h2>
  <p class="about-description">My name is James.  I grew up in the US but for the past 10 years I've been cooking, playing, planting and cooking my way around the globe.  In 2016 I married my wife Chika and we live together in Japan.  These notes were never meant for a larger audience outside of my family and close friends but as I am now a <a class="link inline-link" href="https://joweber123.github.io/jw_creator/">web developer </a>, and have benefited so much from the work of others, I figured it was my time to make some internet as well.  I'd like this to be a space to share what I have learned, and continue to learn, from travelling and exploring this beautiful world.</p>
  <p>Thanks for taking the time to check this out, and check in for more updates to come</p>
