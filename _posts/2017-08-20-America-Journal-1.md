 *"Either I will find a way or I will make one"-saw on a postcard at a coffee shop in Vancouver*

Thank God for vacation.  Chika and I work too much.  Everyone in Japan works too much.  I have so far spent 600 hours in a train going to and from work in the 11 months that I have been employed here in Japan.  Luckily, I have used most every minute of that time to teach myself programming and most of the time I get to sit and annoy my train neighbors by sipping on my thermos of coffee, but still 600 hours just getting to and from work is a little unhealthy.  So it was nice to step away from all of that and get on a plane with my beautiful wife and go back to the motherland for 10 days.

Chika and I are thinking.  We are thinking about what we want to do with our lives and where we want to do that.  And we are investigating.  I love a lot of things about Japan. But, I have always talked very highly of the Northwest in America and just have this beacon inside of me that keeps pointing my mind back to that part of this earth.  I went there when I was a teenager to visit my brother who was in traveling band.  Loved it.  I had just started to play the guitar and I was in the birthplace of Jimmy Hendrix.  What could be better?  I traveled there again as a young 22 year old to promote the volunteer programs of the ELCA.  Loved it.  I stayed with an Indonesian man who made me rice for breakfast which I thought was such a bizarre idea (this was pre-japanese-james remember).  I needed to bring Chika there to show here a place I could never get out of the back of my head.  Historically the Northwest of the US has been a major gathering place for all sorts of asian immigrants and I figured our little ginger asian future babies would fit in nicely.  So we bought way too expensive plane tickets to Seattle and were 36,000 feet in the air flying to an imaginary future in no time.

I, of course, bought us the cheapest plane tickets available which I have already mentioned were way too expensive even then.  This meant we had a 10 hour lay over in Taipei, Taiwan.  Great!  We were able to take the fancy new train from the airport right into the middle of the city and explore for a few hours.  We were instantly stunned at how unbelievably hot and humid it was, even at 8 at night.  We stumbled around looking for food and finally found exactly the little bustling open air restaurant of our dreams and treated ourselves to some little pork dumplings in sesame sauce and a nice beer.  We weren’t even that hungry but we just wanted to be able to say that we had breakfast in Tokyo, Lunch in Taipei and dinner in Washington.  We had 20 minutes to kill before having to go back to the airport and were all to happy to sit down and have some excruciating painful massages given by blind taiwanese men.

My mother bought a plane ticket out to Seattle to visit as well. Her best childhood friend, Maureen,  has lived out in the Northwest her entire adult life, and it was a perfect opportunity to kill two birds with one stone and see lots of people she loved all at once.  So when we landed at 8 at night, and got through the surprisingly agreeable border patrol, my mother and Maureen where there to welcome us back to the US.  

We stayed the first few days in a little suburb of Everett called Lake Vernon at Maureen’s in law’s home.  Their home is objectively large and beautiful by any standard , but for us coming from Japan where “tiny houses” are just houses, its vastness was a very fun welcome back to America present.   For a few days we had a deck overlooking a lake and cake whenever we wanted it and a real life actress living in the basement.  No joke.  I played cribbage, and lost to a women who had been on X-files, Mash and Dirty Harry.  Maureen drove us around to interesting local sites and we recovered from our taiwanese massage looking out the window at beautiful Washington.

On day four we drive the few hours up and across the border to Vancouver, where we stayed at our first Airbnb of the trip.   Vancouver is stunning.  It is located on a tiny island and they have built huge glass towers on every available piece of land in the city center.  Outside of this island the city calms down a bit and there are cute city homes(some that cost $11,000,000!), but on the island it is glass, steel and concrete everywhere you turn your head.  It seems like Vancouver is doing a lot right as a city.  They have dedicated bike lanes, which are packed with bike commuters, and a great public transportation system.  Since it is an island they also have fun little things like a water taxi shlepping 10 people at a time across from the mainland to other islands.  We spent our time split between the glitzy city center and the adjacent residential neighborhoods which have a more earthy yoga feel about them.  

Truth be told though, I found that Vancouver was missing something.  It wasn’t gritty enough for me.   There were no murals on broken walls.   After a while in our glass studded apartment I realized that living in a glass box is actually fairly uncomfortable.  You always feel like the apartments across the road are watching you and you have to spend a lot of time with your curtains closed, which defeats the purpose of having all those windows in the first place.  Also in the city center, from bright and early it was so noisy and just about everywhere in the city they are busy building glassier glass towers and tearing up roads.  Because of wild fires further north in Canada we were denied the full glory of the surrounding mountain views that apparently are breathtaking on a clear day.  While not 100% sold on Vancouver as a city I was 150% sold on Canadians.  From the moment we stepped into the city,  people were so helpful and had all the time in the world to help us.  I used strangers’ cellphones and we didn’t have to pay for the bus twice, even though it was completely my fault for not bringing correct change.  People seemed healthy and happy and I could definitely get used to that.

We said our goodbyes to Maureen in Everett and thanked her for her wonderful company and generosity.   We took the bus and dragged our luggage into Seattle to our second Airbnb.  I had forgotten how hilly Seattle was and felt it as I hauled our 50 pound suitcase up seven blocks to our apartment. This was more the style of home I would like to live in in the future.  The house was built in 1904 and felt more like a home to me. In fact it reminded me of my home in Oconto.   It had wood floors and had been beautifully decorated by our hosts.  They also had all of these new fun toys like lightbulbs whose color you could control with an app, an espresso machine and he had even left a bar of chocolate for us to enjoy at our leisure.  It quiet at night and Capital Hill, the neighborhood where we stayed, feels like a really wonderful place to call home.

Seattle was gritty and a bit too gritty in the beginning but really grew on me as we explored.  Seattle’s architecture is much more diverse and has kept a lot of its old brick buildings.  The downtown, also, I found quite beautiful.  It has a little bit of everything.  It has the old, now a bit too touristy, Public Market right next to bedazzled company headquarters.  It has murals and vine covered walls.  Chika loved the fact that they have a Japanese supermarket stocked with every shade of Japanese food and ingredient one could think of.  People, like in Vancouver, seemed to really be enjoying themselves in the city.  Restaurants were packed and every event we went to was full of families and people who seemed to have a life outside of work.  

Our favorite day was when we boarded a ferry to Bainbridge island,  which is a 30 minute ride full of stunning panoramic views of the city.  From this little island you can still see Seattle off in the distance, but any resemblance of big city life melted aways as we meandered down the quant downtown streets.  The island offered just enough amenities to feel comfortable but not overwhelm you with choice.  We had a fish taco lunch with too much wine at the most spectacular public house on the water next to the marina.  You could see the city skyline from our patio table but also sail boats and the island’s tree covered hills and little houses with docks.   We imagined what life would be like living on such a comfortable and peaceful island.  Of course houses cost well over $500,000 and I would have to commute by ferry everyday, come rain or shine, but it still is one of the dreamiest places I have found yet to live.

Our last experience was taking the fancy new tram back to the airport to be whisked off back to our little island here.  That last little train ride illuminated to me all that is truly great about America.  The seats behind us were two rows facing each other which could fit about 10 people.  First a family of three got on with their bicycles.  They had a little girl who was probably five or so.  At the next stop a group of 4 adults that were returning from a “Slayer” concert hoped on and sat in front of this family.  They were covered in tattoos and facial piercings and looked, quite frankly, a bit scary.  Next, people coming back from a baseball game all liquored up sat down with their hats and jerseys and noisemakers.  And the great thing is, this big diverse group of people spent the whole train ride talking with one another.  They all talked about how nice this and that was, and the dad was apparently a secret Slayer fan as well.  They were just so darn pleasant to each other.  This all was happening at the same time two men sat down next to each other in front of us, met for the first time and within 15 minutes, when one had to leave, they gave each other a kiss on the lips with a very flirty batting of the eyes.  This whole situation suddenly began to be DJ’d by a man who accidentally turned on some 90’s R&B on his incredibly powerful bluetooth speaker and decided it was a good idea to just leave it on for the whole rest of the train ride.  We get a lot of bad news about America here in Japan with shootings and Trump and terror, and to be honest I don’t ever feel 100% safe in cities in America like I do here in Japan, but those people wouldn’t have talked on the train here in Japan, and those men wouldn’t have felt comfortable kissing in public and we wouldn’t have been treated to the impromptu unanticipated DJ session.  Don’t get me wrong, people all over the world are quirky.  Americans, however, unabashedly pump out R&B on trains and while it might not be my flavor of ice cream I can appreciate and respect that brazenness.

We are back safe and sound in Japan now and rolled up again in work life.  I continue to chip away at learning how to program and Chika is going to start taking classes on web design and also the trumpet.  We have cat friends around our neighborhood that wait for us when we get home from work I get to eat mama’s bento lunch she faithfully makes for me every day.  We are enjoying Japan for the moment and are contemplating a Europe trip in the spring to visit friends and discover new places there together.  

cats and acrobats,

-James
